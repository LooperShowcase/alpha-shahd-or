      <h1>volleyball</h1>
      <p>
        Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are
        separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball
        on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part
        of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.
        Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996.
        The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is
        sitting volleyball. The complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play
        essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a
        'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it
        with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court,
        over the net, and into the receiving team's court.[3] The receiving team
        must not let the ball be grounded within their court. The team may touch
        the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the
        court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice
        consecutively.[3] Typically, the first two touches are used to set up
        for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the
        net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the
        ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins
        the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next
        rally. A few of the most common faults include: to score points by
        grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. The
        complete set of rules is extensive,[2] but play essentially proceeds as
        follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the

        attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team
        receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally,
        thus, losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point
        and serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common
        faults include: causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside
        the opponents' court or without first passing over the net; catching and
        throwing the ball; double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball
        made by the same player; four consecutive contacts with the ball made by
        the same team; net foul: touching the net during play; foot fault: the
        foot crosses over the boundary line when serving or under the net when a
        front row player is trying to keep the ball in play.


        In December 1895,[5] in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of badminton,[6] as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from other sports such as baseball, tennis and handball.[7] Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.

The first rules, written down by William G. Morgan, called for a net 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) high, a 25 ft × 50 ft (7.6 m × 15.2 m) court, and any number of players. A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents' court. In case of a serving error, a second try was allowed. Hitting the ball into the net was considered a foul (with loss of the point or a side-out)—except in the case of the first-try serve.

After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: "volley ball"). Volleyball rules were slightly modified by the International YMCA Training School and the game spread around the country to various YMCAs.[8][9]

In the early 1900s Spalding, through its publishing company American Sports Publishing Company, produced books with complete instruction and rules for the sport.[10]

The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first official ball in 1896, while others claim it was created in 1900.[11][12][13] The rules evolved over time: in 1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced, and four years later a "three hits" rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established. In 1917, the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win. In 1919, about 16,000 volleyballs were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops and allies, which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries.[11]

The first country outside the United States to adopt volleyball was Canada in 1900.[11] An international federation, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women.[14] The sport is now popular in Brazil, in Europe (where especially Italy, the Netherlands, and countries from Eastern Europe have been major forces since the late 1980s), in Russia, and in other countries including China and the rest of Asia, as well as in the United States.[8][9][14]


A nudist/naturist volleyball game at the Sunny Trails Club during the 1958 Canadian Sunbathing Association (CSA) convention in British Columbia, Canada
Beach volleyball, a variation of the game played on sand and with only two players per team, became a FIVB-endorsed variation in 1987 and was added to the Olympic program at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[11][14] Volleyball is also a sport at the Paralympics managed by the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled.

Nudists were early adopters of the game with regular organized play in clubs as early as the late 1920s.[15][16] By the 1960s, a volleyball court had become standard in almost all nudist/naturist clubs.[17]
